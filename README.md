# C++ Snippets
Includes the data structures that I implemented or while taking notes of some course.
Includes non-trivial algorithms.
Includes the CP snippets that I frequently use. These were taken from various libraries and may have been tweaked. Could skip most if focus is on Interviews. Read DSU & Kruskal, combinatorics, binary exponentiation, sieve and maybe segment trees.
